# not-a-real-application
Hey y'all, This is my first ever HTML project! I actually learned HTML a few weeks ago, but my mistake was just watching tutorials without trying anything hands-on. So, while making this silly little page, I basically relearned everything from scratch.

It’s not meant to be anything serious—I knew that trying to make something perfect on my first attempt would only overwhelm me. Instead, I focused on creating something fun and simple, exactly the way I imagined it.

I made this for my girl friends, and they loved it—which was the main goal! I might look back and cringe at it a few days from now, but for the moment, I’m honestly really proud of it.
